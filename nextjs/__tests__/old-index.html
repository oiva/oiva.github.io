    Hello there. I'm <a href="/about">this guy</a>
    and this is my home page. Below are all blog posts I have written since 2007.
    Some of them are silly, but self-censorship would be worse I guess.

          <a class="post-link" href="/2020/06/28/youtube-recommendations/">Youtube recommendations</a>
        </h2>
        
          
          <p class="post-excerpt"><p>I’ve been watching a lot more Youtube lately. Maybe their algorithms have gotten better at recommending interesting videos or maybe it’s that there’s been little else to do lately.</p>

<p>Youtube is finding more videos in random categories I didn’t know were a thing but I find intereseting. I thought I’d share a couple of them. Of course as with anything on Youtube, these are wildly popular within their niche and might be old news. Anyway, today’s recommendation:</p>

<h2 id="daniel-duskins-mixing-videos">Daniel Duskin’s mixing videos:</h2>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Em9EwVQy-6s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Daniel is a mixing engineer (selling sound mixing services) and he demonstrates his skills on Youtube by strapping a GoPro to his head and fliming himself mixing classic songs on an analog mixing console. Like Queen’s “Don’t Stop Me Now” above.</p>

<p>Daniel doesn’t try to replicate the original songs but does a quick, maybe even better, mix from individual instrument tracks (sourced where???). It’s wild to see and hear how a song comes together with each new instrument.</p>

<p>Another video of mixing The Doobie Brothers’ “Long Train Running” has explanations of what he’s doing although heavy with mixing lingo:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_QkyzM0xLLk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Daniel makes mixing look so easy and effortless. Of course one thing to note is that the source material on these videos is super good.</p>

<p>A lot of effort went into composing and recording these songs and planning how all the instruments play together even before mixing. “Long Train Running” is already groovy as hell with only the drums and guitar. You wouldn’t be able to quickly mix ten garbage tracks and make the song <em>sing</em> the same way.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-round-nile-rodgers-tells-the-story-of-lets-dance">Bonus round: Nile Rodgers Tells The Story of “Let’s Dance”</h2>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NlDCPCwVNUw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This is a quick, heartwarming story of how Nile Rodgers, one of all-time best guitarists and artists took David Bowie’s simple guitar riff and turned it into “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Dance_\(David_Bowie_song\)">Let’s Dance</a>”, a massive hit in 1982. Pure magic.</p>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/2019/10/31/infotoggle-technical-side/">Technical learnings from InfoToggle</a>
        </h2>
        
          
          <p class="post-excerpt"><p>I’ve been building a SaaS product called InfoToggle as a side project. My
<a href="/2019/10/21/infotoggle/">previous post</a> has details on what it is and what it
does.</p>

<p>As a programmer having a side project is a good way to learn new technologies
that you might not come across in your regular job. Having a <em>project</em> means
there’s a clear problem you want to solve and you get to choose the most
suitable tools to solve it.</p>

<p>In the context of <a href="https://infotoggle.com">InfoToggle</a> I had a chance to learn
multiple new tools, including Laravel, Docker, React Hooks, Stripe, and some
AWS features like CloudFront.</p>

<h2 id="laravel-thumbs-up">Laravel: thumbs up</h2>

<p>A big initial impetus for this whole project was to test out <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel
framework</a>. I had heard many good things about it and
wanted to see what a <em>modern</em> PHP framework would look like. I’e used Zend
Framework in my jobby job and it works there but it’s no fun to use really.</p>

<p>Laravel’s tagline “freeing you to create without sweating the small things”
is pretty spot on. The framework has a lot of built-in functionality and
sensible defaults for creating basic web apps. Creating new routes,
controllers, database migrations, and events is all very streamlined.</p>

<p>Occasionally some of the inner workings of Laravel might feel a bit too magical
which might become a problem in a bigger web app. The call stacks for some of
the errors are *wild* but mostly <em>it just works</em> and it’s fast enough for a
basic web app. Laravel’s documentation is also pretty good, at least compared to
Zend.</p>

<h2 id="technical-challenges-with-stripe">Technical Challenges with Stripe</h2>

<p>One of the biggest hurdles was building the subscription system. Billing happens
through <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> and integrating with their subscription
flow took a month and a half (not full time, but working hours here and there.)
That’s a pretty big chunk of time where little progress was made.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, Stripe is probably the best payment processor there is and
others would probably have taken far longer. The problem with Stripe was mostly
that there are quite many different ways to create a sign up / subscription flow
and there is no clear path to choose the correct one.</p>

<p>On top of that their documentation occasionally had PSD2-related warnings “Are
you in Europe? Then you probably shouldn’t be using this method but this other
one here which is in beta and doesn’t have the same features.”</p>

<h3 id="stripe-webhook-matching">Stripe webhook matching</h3>

<p>Most of Stripe’s flows work by sending requests to a
<a href="https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks">webhook</a> you set up. One of the biggest
source of my confusion was that there was no single way of matching an incoming
webhook event to a customer.</p>

<p>You can tie a “client reference ID” to Stripe’s customer objects (usually the
customer’s ID in your own system) but only some of the events sent back to you
include the reference. Other times you are left trying to match a subscription
ID to a ID you know or in worst case an email address.</p>

<p>Some of Stripe’s events include a Customer ID (in Stripe’s system) and once you
can match that to a known ID you are mostly set. But for example the “customer
created”, “subscription created”, and “invoice created” events can arrive in any
order and each has a different set of identifiers that you must keep track of
and try to match to later requests. I still have a hundred line function whose
only job is to match an incoming Stripe event to a customer in my database.</p>

<h2 id="docker">Docker</h2>

<p>I’ve avoided Docker for a very long time, mostly because in my job I have worked
on just a single project where I had the development and production environments
set up. But at this point Docker seems to be required knowledge pretty much
everywhere so why not try it?</p>

<p>It seems that waiting with Docker was partly a good thing. Researching how to
configure Docker (and Docker Compose) revealed that the configuration options
and syntaxes haves changed at least a couple times. This made following
tutorials quite difficult as most of the examples didn’t work anymore when run
against a recent version of Docker.</p>

<p>What’s positive about docker is that it makes deployments easy. Replicating the
production environment is also easy although I haven’t needed that apart from
adding a separate testing environment.</p>

<p>Docker was also the biggest source of WTFs along with Stripe. Most of this stems
from all Docker tutorials and examples being about building a <em>development</em>
environment with Docker.</p>

<p>Very little of that is applicable when deploying to production which was what I
tried to achieve. For example Docker volumes work completely different locally
and on a server. In the end I needed to have two separate configurations for
building the development environment and the production environment which feels
a bit silly.</p>

<p>Another small disadvantage with Docker is that deployments on the go over a cell
phone connection take a long time. Apparently there’s quite a lot of data
transfer happening?</p>

<h2 id="react-hooks">React Hooks</h2>

<p>Quick shout out to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">React Hooks</a>:
they work, and make developing basic components that much nicer. Use them.</p>

<p>That’s it for now! Everything sort of works and I’m pretty happy with the stack
as it is. There are also many parts that didn’t get a mention, maybe more on
those next time.</p>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/2019/10/21/infotoggle/">InfoToggle</a>
        </h2>
        
          
          <p class="post-excerpt"><p>I’ve been building a product for displaying announcements and alert messages on
ecommerce websites, called <a href="https://infotoggle.com">InfoToggle</a>. It started out
as a side project and has now grown to a point where it might actually be
useful to others as well.</p>

<p>The problem InfoToggle solves is pretty simple and is something we see in my
current work at <a href="https://www.popvakuutus.fi">POP Vakuutus</a> quite often. We sell
insurance but a successful sale depends on multiple external systems, for
example the national vehicle database Trafi, a credit check service, and 
customer authentication, a service provided by banks. Any of these systems
might and do break from time to time. Especially Trafi has a notoriously bad
uptime record and often does unscheduled service breaks they only announce
afterwards. During an outage we might not be able to sell a single vehicle
insurance but such is life.</p>

<p>If any of these services breaks there’s not much we can do but wait. One thing
we <em>can</em> do is communicate the disruption and its extent to our customers. Due
to the ecommerce aspect it has to be done in a way that doesn’t scare away
customers not affected by the disruption. If a disruption prevents customers
from buying a car insurance, it’s best to only inform customers about to buy
car insurance and preferably ask them to try again later.</p>

<p>Here’s where InfoToggle comes in: it lets site owners create messages for
situations like these and easily *toggle* them on. For service
breaks known in advance a message can be timed to be visible the duration of
the break.</p>

<p>Of course the messages added to your site can be whatever: announcements,
discount codes… InfoToggle lets you add any HTML, CSS, and JS code you need
to your site. But I feel it’s useful to frame it around situations where you
quickly need to communicate things to your customers. Once an initial set of
messages have been defined they can easily be duplicated and modified.</p>

<p>Not every site needs a system like this–a good CMS will let you do all of
this. What I’m willing to bet is that there are a lot of ecommerce sites that
don’t have a good CMS :)</p>

<h2 id="side-hustle">Side hustle</h2>

<p>InfoToggle started as and still is a side project. One motivator was to try out
new tech (which I will expand on later) and have fun coding challenges.</p>

<p>It also provides a chance to practice many non-technical skills like product
development and marketing.</p>

<p>Of course being limited to a couple of hours after work and on weekends means
any progress is a bit slow but the development combined to trying to sell a
product gives great focus. There are countless things you could do but you have
to choose the single most important feature (or bug) and get it done.
I think it’s also great for learning new things.</p>

<h2 id="going-forward">Going Forward</h2>

<p>InfoToggle is now at a point where technically it works and it’s in production
use. There are a ton of features and improvements still to do but I also need
to focus on marketing and selling hard. All in all it’s still super early and
we’ll see how it goes. I’ll keep you posted :)</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2016/11/24/a-winter-bike/">A Winter Mountain Bike</a>
        </h2>
        
          
          <p class="post-excerpt"><p><img src="/images/2016/11/rcz-race-ra.jpg" alt="RCZ Race RA" width="686" /></p>

<p>After some unfortunate bike-thieving-events half a year ago I was left with
only one bike: a White road bike. It’s a good bike, I even scored a pair of
carbon wheels for it.</p>

<p>Still, one bike is hardly enough. This year I wanted to continue the cycling
season through the winter so a winter bike was needed. I also wanted a mountain
bike even though I’ve spent very little time in the forest lately. But it might
happen, you know?</p>

<p>Could these two bikes be combined? Maybe a <em>rigid</em> mountain bike that’s fast on
the road but still survives some trails?</p>

<p>My last mountain bike had a suspension fork. It was nice. Trying to decide if
having a rigid mountain bike was sane I came across this perfect answer on
Quora:</p>

  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.quora.com/widgets/content"></script>
</span></p>

<p>Anyway, as you might have guessed from the picture, I found a used RCZ mountain
bike for a fair price. With a belt drive instead of chain, no suspension and no 
gears it’s <em>very</em> low maintenance and perfect for winter cycling. The tires
hold OK in snow and icy asphalt. How it handles in the forest remains to be
seen but I try not to stress too much about it.</p>

<h3 id="update">Update</h3>

<p>I did take the bike on to some trails and participated in VPCX anniversary
competition (a local, not so serious cyclocross competition). The bike’s
geometry was good but the gearing was really not suitable for off-road. Still a
lot of fun.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2016/01/21/people-switching-to-fuji/">Stories about switching to Fuji</a>
        </h2>
        
          
          <p class="post-excerpt"><p>Some experiences from folks who’ve switched to from Nikon to Fuji systems,
something I might be doing as well. Many of these talk about Fuji’s X-T1 which
is the big brother of the X-T10 I’m interested in but also about the reasons
for switching.</p>

<p>What’s funny is that almost all of them seem to be doing the switch after
owning a Nikon D800. That’s one particularly big DSLR which might play a part
in why people start looking for something smaller.</p>

<h4 id="bye-bye-nikon-hello-fujifilm"><a href="https://bjornmoerman.blogspot.fi/2014/07/bye-bye-nikon-hello-fujifilm.html">Bye bye NIKON, Hello FUJIFILM!</a></h4>

<p><strong>Bjorn Moerman’s</strong> experience switching from Nikon D800 to then Fuji family.</p>

<blockquote>
When was the last time Nikon or Canon came out with a brand new
camera feature on a camera that has been out more than 12 months?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I sincerely believe that by 2020 there will be hardly any new
classic DSLR's being sold.
</blockquote>

<h4 id="from-nikon-to-fuji-20000-pictures-with-the-x-t1"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZM40jC2ueE">From Nikon to Fuji, 20,000 pictures with the x-t1</a></h4>

<p>A video from <strong>Lukas Gisbert-Mora</strong>, a wedding photographer, about the reasons why he 
switched to Fuji X-T1. Including limitations of the Fuji.</p>

<blockquote>
  At a wedding, actually on the dance floor, when I compared my shots taken with
  a Nikon and the Fuji, I could actually see that the Fuji was performing
  better.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  When you look in the EVF (electronic viewfinder) it tells you exactly what
  the exposure is like, before you take the shot. You can actually be much
  quicker with [the Fuji] than a DSLR ... You just keep the camera to your eye
  and just adjust the aperture.

<p><strong>Mel Hattie</strong>, from the perspective of switching a full $$$$ Nikon system and
actually saving money in the process.</p>

<blockquote>
Despite the solid construction, the Fuji X-T1 is very light. There's a
noticeable size and weight difference when I'm carrying it around, and I feel
comfortable pulling it out on the street without attracting a lot of attention.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  There are definitely things I'll miss about the Nikon D800: Dual card slots,
  snappier autofocus, higher ISO tolerance, the video capabilities.
</blockquote>

<h4 id="switching-to-fuji---first-impressions"><a href="http://www.andymumford.co.uk/blog/switching-to-fuji-first-impressions/">Switching to Fuji - First Impressions</a></h4>

<p><strong>Andy Mumford’s</strong> comparison of Nikon D800E and Fuji X-T10. Many side-by-side
photos from both cameras</p>

<blockquote>
After spending some time playing around with the images from the XT10, I'm
really impressed by the image quality and really don't feel as though I'm
losing anything significant from the Nikon D800E in real world shooting
conditions.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  I think we’ve reached a point with image quality where improvements are more
  technical than real world for the work I do and I want small, light, cameras
  that feel almost invisible when shooting with them or carrying them around,
  and I want a camera that's fun to use and experiment with.
