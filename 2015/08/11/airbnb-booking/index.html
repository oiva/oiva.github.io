<p>During a recent road trip to Croatia we booked most of our accommodation
through <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a>. We hadn't booked anything in
advance and at the height of the summer season there were no cheap hotels left.
Airbnb had much more choice and prices were reasonable if not cheap.</p>
<p>This was my first time of really using Airbnb and I was surprised to find out
that all the apartments and rooms we booked were run by professional
accommodation businesses. One was actually a hostel but really felt more like
a hotel minus the breakfast.</p>
<p>I had an obviously erroneous image of Airbnb selection consisting of people
renting out their flats but it seems these companies just use Airbnb as an
additional sales channel. The same apartments could have been booked for
example through booking.com.</p>
<p>Not that there's anything wrong with that. It was just a bit surprising
considering the image I had of Airbnb. It's understandable that touristy cities
have lots of apartments to rent and they are sold through any channel possible.</p>
<p>One downside of this is that many of the places we looked didn't have reviews
on Airbnb but they might have had on other booking sites. Airbnb also hides the
exact location of the apartments prior to booking them which seems a bit
unnecessary given they are not anyone's homes. Anyway, one lesson learned
again.</p>
