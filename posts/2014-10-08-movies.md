I like movies and I have studied a tiny bit what goes into making one. Still, 
at the movies I'm just enjoying the movie, not looking at how it was made. 
I might notice a clever cut or [good lighting](http://imgur.com/a/cpLno), but 
most of the that just goes by and helps telling a story.

That's why it's fun to see studies of different directors where someone points 
out all the tricks they use.

Here's one example about the stuff David Fincher does, or doesn't do.
