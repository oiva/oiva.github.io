Here are two articles about **useful Git options that most people should probably use**:

- [Popular Git options](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/02/16/popular-git-config-options/) by Julia Evans. This came out already a year ago but I was "too busy" to read it then.

- [How Core Git Developers Configure Git](https://blog.gitbutler.com/how-git-core-devs-configure-git/) by Scott Chacon.

These two lists are largely overlapping but Julia's has a grab bag of smaller, yet useful options. I like Scott's categorization of options, including options that "Clearly Makes Git Better":

> This first group of settings *clearly* makes Git better by default. There are generally zero downsides to enabling any of them.
