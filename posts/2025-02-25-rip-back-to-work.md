Being so far {% footnoteref "podcast-queue" "Still some left:<br><img src='/images/2025/overcast-2025.webp' alt='Icon of Overcast, my podcast player of choice, displaying a red badge with the number 239 on it. The number is the amount of unlistened episodes in my queue.' width='145' height='152'>" %}behind my podcast queue{%endfootnoteref %} means I completely missed [Back to Work podcast](https://www.backtowork.limo) ending in April 2024.

This was one of those podcasts where the hosts felt like your friends because I listened to them speak for 13 years. I have very specific memories of the show tied to certain locations. It also did help me do better work.

So I'm sad it's not there anymore, but nothing really is permanent. I'm also very thankful this "pound sign productivity" podcast existed.
