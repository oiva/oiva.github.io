After some unfortunate bike-thieving-events half a year ago I was left with
only one bike: a White road bike. It's a good bike, I even scored a pair of
carbon wheels for it.

Still, one bike is hardly enough. This year I wanted to continue the cycling
season through the winter so a winter bike was needed. I also wanted a mountain
bike even though I've spent very little time in the forest lately. But it might
happen, you know?

Could these two bikes be combined? Maybe a *rigid* mountain bike that's fast on
the road but still survives some trails?

My last mountain bike had a suspension fork. It was nice. Trying to decide if
having a rigid mountain bike was sane I came across this <a href="https://qr.ae/pYNt7a">perfect answer on Quora</a>.

Anyway, as you might have guessed from the picture, I found a used RCZ mountain
bike for a fair price. With a belt drive instead of chain, no suspension and no 
gears it's *very* low maintenance and perfect for winter cycling. The tires
hold OK in snow and icy asphalt. How it handles in the forest remains to be
seen but I try not to stress too much about it.

### Update

I did take the bike on to some trails and participated in VPCX anniversary
competition (a local, not so serious cyclocross competition). The bike's
geometry was good but the gearing was really not suitable for off-road. Still a
lot of fun.
