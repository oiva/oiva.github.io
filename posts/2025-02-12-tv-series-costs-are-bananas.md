This tidbit about Apple TV+'s 'Severance' caught my eye: From [Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/ben-stiller-severance-apple-filmmaking-parents-documentary-1236126909/) (via [MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/severance-season-3-work-now-underway/)):

> *Puck* reported that **this season of Severance approached the price tag of $20 million per episode**. Stiller declines to state a budget for the show, saying: “Both seasons have been interrupted by these force majeure things that threw everything upside down, so it’s never had a regular season where you could just say, ‘Yeah, this is what it is.’

It's not anything new, but I always forget just how much money is poured into making these "prestige TV" shows. $20 million *per episode*.

And apparently 'Severance' is not even the worst. The Marvel Cinematic Universe shows are said to have cost up to $25 million per episode:

> Disney is sparing no expense on programming, projecting a 2020 original content budget short of $1 billion. The Mandalorian is said to cost $15 million an episode, for instance, and a source pegs Marvel entries The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, WandaVision and Hawkeye at as much as $25 million per episode.

Wikipedia naturally has a '[List of most expensive television series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_television_series)'.

"Big" Finnish movies typically have budgets around 1–3 million euros, so with $20 million you could make like ten movies here!

That's a very apples to oranges comparison for sure, but it's fun to think about what "more" you get production-wise for the $20M. Bigger stars, more expensive directors, lots of CGI... I bet the catering is better too.
