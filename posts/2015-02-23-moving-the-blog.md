It seems that blogs are more or less 
[on their way out](http://www.marco.org/2015/02/16/google-and-blogs-shit). On 
the other hand people publish more material than ever, but it's divided into a 
multitude of services based on content and context. Personal life updates go to 
Facebook, vacation photos to Instagram, goofy links to Tumblr and professional
stuff to Twitter.

My blog is no exception. Its updates have slowed to a steady pace of one or 
two posts a year while I happily tweet on Twitter and code on GitHub. This 
led me to thinking that I could save my blog and create **one central place** 
for all the stuff I produce elsewhere on the net. You know, to better build my 
*personal&nbsp;braaand*.

Of course, if you think about it for a minute, the answer is 
pretty clearly **no**. Not only would it be a great hassle to set up, but 
it would duplicate content somewhere where people didn't expect to find it.
Audiences on different services have formed there for a reason. People who 
follow me on Twitter probably don't care about the food shots in my 
[Instagram feed](https://instagram.com/bobs/ "You should totally follow me.").

The kind of websites I've enjoyed lately are often personal blogs that just
have clear and concise writing, and none of the cruft. The kind of pages that 
almost look like [Instapapered](https://www.instapaper.com) before 
<span title="Yes it's a verb">instapapering</span> them. Granted, I don't
always know whose blogs I've been reading, but those who are particularly good
I will follow on Twitter and maybe share their post there too.

Subscribing to a blog might be a bit more rare these days, especially after
Google Reader died. But I'm not sure if it's all bad. Old-fashioned blog posts 
still tend to work on their own because people find them through Google or 
social sharing.

Anyway, following this train of thought I ended up with two criteria for my
future website: 

1. I want to have a place where I can easily put text on the Internet
2. I could have a starting point for people googling me (or more realistically 
just to answer "what is your website?" questions on web forms.)
3. (I would like to own the content[^1].)

In the end I decided to host my blog content on
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), accessible through my own
domain[^2]. Easy, and totally building my brand. It remains to be seen if that
helps me write any more blog posts. The chances are low, but who knows.

    I've spent enough time on the Internet to known that you need to host 
    your blog content yourself (sorry [Medium](https://medium.com/).) I once had
    a blog on [Posterous](http://www.posterous.com/) only to see it die a year 
    later.

    The tech stack of the blog (mostly [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) really)
    and all the steps needed for you to read this post might be a topic for a
    follow-up post.
