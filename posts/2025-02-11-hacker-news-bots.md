In 2011 I created a few Twitter bots that would find posts from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) and post them to Twitter. The bots would only post links that had over 200, 250, or 500 points.

Once Twitter imploded I moved these bots to Mastodon. Recently a person contacted me and requested the bots would also be on Bluesky, which I now managed to do.

## Mastodon

There are multiple bots to let people balance the amount of links they see. Personally I like to 250 points level which posts around 10 links a day.

The 750 and 1000 point accounts didn't exist before, but I added those now. I'm not sure, but I feel there's been some inflation in Hacker News, and more posts go over 500 points. Some data scientist somewhere has probably crunched the numbers.

P.S. I'm a bit worried about the Bluesky accounts, as there doesn't seem to be a way to mark the profiles as being bots. Mastodon has a clear checkbox "this&nbsp;is an automated account" and I checked with Toot.community admins that it's OK to create these bots. We'll see how it goes with Bluesky.
