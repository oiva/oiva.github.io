  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I've been watching a lot more Youtube lately. Maybe their algorithms have gotten better at recommending interesting videos or maybe it's that there's been little else to do lately.</p>
<p>Youtube is finding more videos in random categories I didn't know were a thing but I find intereseting. I thought I'd share a couple of them. Of course as with anything on Youtube, these are wildly popular within their niche and might be old news. Anyway, today's recommendation:</p>
<h2>Daniel Duskin's mixing videos:</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Em9EwVQy-6s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Daniel is a mixing engineer (selling sound mixing services) and he demonstrates his skills on Youtube by strapping a GoPro to his head and fliming himself mixing classic songs on an analog mixing console. Like Queen's &quot;Don't Stop Me Now&quot; above.</p>
<p>Daniel doesn't try to replicate the original songs but does a quick, maybe even better, mix from individual instrument tracks (sourced where???). It's wild to see and hear how a song comes together with each new instrument.</p>
<p>Another video of mixing The Doobie Brothers' &quot;Long Train Running&quot; has explanations of what he's doing although heavy with mixing lingo:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_QkyzM0xLLk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Daniel makes mixing look so easy and effortless. Of course one thing to note is that the source material on these videos is super good.</p>
<p>A lot of effort went into composing and recording these songs and planning how all the instruments play together even before mixing. &quot;Long Train Running&quot; is already groovy as hell with only the drums and guitar. You wouldn't be able to quickly mix ten garbage tracks and make the song <em>sing</em> the same way.</p>
<h2>Bonus round: Nile Rodgers Tells The Story of &quot;Let's Dance&quot;</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NlDCPCwVNUw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This is a quick, heartwarming story of how Nile Rodgers, one of all-time best guitarists and artists took David Bowie's simple guitar riff and turned it into &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Dance_(David_Bowie_song)">Let's Dance</a>&quot;, a massive hit in 1982. Pure magic.</p>
