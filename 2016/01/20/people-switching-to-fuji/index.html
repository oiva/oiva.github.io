  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Some experiences from folks who've switched to from Nikon to Fuji systems,
something I might be doing as well. Many of these talk about Fuji's X-T1 which
is the big brother of the X-T10 I'm interested in but also about the reasons
for switching.</p>
<p>What's funny is that almost all of them seem to be doing the switch after
owning a Nikon D800. That's one particularly big DSLR which might play a part
in why people start looking for something smaller.</p>
<h4><a href="http://bjornmoerman.blogspot.fi/2014/07/bye-bye-nikon-hello-fujifilm.html">Bye bye NIKON, Hello FUJIFILM!</a></h4>
<p><strong>Bjorn Moerman's</strong> experience switching from Nikon D800 to then Fuji family.</p>
<blockquote>
When was the last time Nikon or Canon came out with a brand new
camera feature on a camera that has been out more than 12 months?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I sincerely believe that by 2020 there will be hardly any new
classic DSLR's being sold.
</blockquote>
<h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZM40jC2ueE">From Nikon to Fuji, 20,000 pictures with the x-t1</a></h4>
<p>A video from <strong>Lukas Gisbert-Mora</strong>, a wedding photographer, about the reasons why he
switched to Fuji X-T1. Including limitations of the Fuji.</p>
<blockquote>
  At a wedding, actually on the dance floor, when I compared my shots taken with
  a Nikon and the Fuji, I could actually see that the Fuji was performing
  better.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  When you look in the EVF (electronic viewfinder) it tells you exactly what
  the exposure is like, before you take the shot. You can actually be much
  quicker with [the Fuji] than a DSLR ... You just keep the camera to your eye
  and just adjust the aperture.

<h4><a href="http://melhadtea.com/switching-from-the-nikon-d800-to-the-fuji-xt1/">Switching from the Nikon D800 to the Fuji X-T1</a></h4>
<p><strong>Mel Hattie</strong>, from the perspective of switching a full $$$$ Nikon system and
actually saving money in the process.</p>
<blockquote>
Despite the solid construction, the Fuji X-T1 is very light. There's a
noticeable size and weight difference when I'm carrying it around, and I feel
comfortable pulling it out on the street without attracting a lot of attention.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  There are definitely things I'll miss about the Nikon D800: Dual card slots,
  snappier autofocus, higher ISO tolerance, the video capabilities.
</blockquote>
<h4><a href="http://www.andymumford.co.uk/blog/switching-to-fuji-first-impressions/">Switching to Fuji - First Impressions</a></h4>
<p><strong>Andy Mumford's</strong> comparison of Nikon D800E and Fuji X-T10. Many side-by-side
photos from both cameras</p>
<blockquote>
After spending some time playing around with the images from the XT10, I'm
really impressed by the image quality and really don't feel as though I'm
losing anything significant from the Nikon D800E in real world shooting
conditions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  I think weâ€™ve reached a point with image quality where improvements are more
  technical than real world for the work I do and I want small, light, cameras
  that feel almost invisible when shooting with them or carrying them around,
  and I want a camera that's fun to use and experiment with.
