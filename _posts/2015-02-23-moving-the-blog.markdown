It seems that blogs are more or less [on their way out](http://www.marco.org/2015/02/16/google-and-blogs-shit). People publish material
more than ever but it's divided into a multitude of services based on context.
Personal life updates might go to Facebook, vacation photos to Instagram,
goofy links to Tumblr and professional stuff to Twitter.

This led me thinking if I should have one central place for all the stuff I 
produce on the net. But the answer is pretty clearly no. Not only would it be a 
great hassle to set up, but it would duplicate content, and people who follow
me on Twitter probably don't care about my Instagram feed. Old-fashioned blog
posts tend to work fine on their own because people find them through Google
anyway.

In the end I decided I just needed to have my blog content in one easily
updatable place, preferably on my own domain. I've spent enough time on the
Internet to learn that you need to host your blog content yourself. I once had
a blog on [Posterous](http://www.posterous.com/) only to see it die :(

### WordPress or not?

My old WordPress site was really starting to show its age but I didn't want to
spend any more time configuring WordPress or finding decent themes for it.
