[Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w) is a great podcast about productivity,
communication and many other things. From time to time the hosts Dan and Merlin
recommend books and comics they've read. The books cover a wide range as well,
from Buddhism to Unix to cooking.

Personally I like book recommendations and reading stuff at least someone has
deemed worthy. So I created a [small script](https://github.com/oiva/b2w) that
scrapes all the book recommendations from Back to Work's feed and
assembles [Back to Work Reading List](http://oivaeskola.fi/b2w/). Hope you find
it useful!
