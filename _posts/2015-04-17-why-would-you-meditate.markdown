The other day I stumbled upon a Facebook argument about meditation: is it 
about *suppressing* bad memories, or *processing* bad memories? The person
thinking meditation suppresses memories naturally considered it harmful, and a
possibly dangerous fad.

IANAB (I'm not a Buddhist) and my experience in meditation is very limited, but
I'd be willing to argue meditation is neither. It's more about being ready when
the next bad thing happens. Or a good thing for that matter.

The reward from meditation is to gain clarity and to be ready for whatever life
throws you. Sometimes life throws you lemons and it pays to realize that it's
something that does happen from time to time, that it might not even be
anything to get angry at, and maybe even see the lemonade-making opportunities
that await you.

There are certain aspects of meditation that might give a 'thought suppression'
vibe. From
[Wikipedia's great meditation article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation):

<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation">
  <p>Meditation often involves an internal effort to self-regulate the mind in
     some way. Meditation is often used to clear the mind ...</p>
</blockquote>

But in this context clearing your mind or self-regulating your thoughts
does not mean *not* thinking certain thoughts you feel are 'bad'.

The point of meditation exercises is to build a transparent layer between your
thoughts and you. That layer's job is to detect and acknowledge the thoughts that run
through your mind, to understand how they make you feel and why, and to assess
if there's any real reason to get upset about that email you got.

All in all, I'm a bit more positive about using meditation to process memories,
but way more using it as a tool to better survive everyday life without stress
and being prepared for any possible future.
