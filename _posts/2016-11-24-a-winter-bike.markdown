After some unfortunate bike-thieving-events half a year ago I was left with
only one bike: a White road bike. It's a good bike, I even scored a pair of
carbon wheels for it.

Still, one bike is hardly enough. This year I wanted to continue the cycling
season through the winter so a winter bike was needed. I also wanted a mountain
bike even though I've spent very little time in the forest lately. But it might
happen, you know?

Could these two bikes be combined? Maybe a *rigid* mountain bike that's fast on
the road but still survives some trails?

My last mountain bike had a suspension fork. It was nice. Trying to decide if
having a rigid mountain bike was sane I came across this perfect answer on
Quora:

Anyway, as you might have guessed from the picture, I found a used RCZ mountain
bike for a fair price. With a belt drive instead of chain, no suspension and no 
gears it's *very* low maintenance and perfect for winter cycling. The tires
hold OK in snow and icy asphalt. How it handles in the forest remains to be
seen but I try not to stress too much about it.
