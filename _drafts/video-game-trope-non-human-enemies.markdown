I recently finished [Last of Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us),
a third-person action-adventure game and I'm currently playing [Far Cry 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Cry_4),
a first-person action-adventure shooter. Both are superb, critically acclaimed
games.

Both of them also suffer from the same trope

1. Get the player up to speed


###Far Cry 1 - Mutants

Far Cry 4 brought back painful memories about [Far Cry 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Cry_(video_game)).
When the game was released in 2004 its huge open world was *insane*. At
the time there were few games that looked as good or had as big maps for the
player to explore.

Far Cry's gameplay was fun: you could swim around an island, hit the enemy from
behind and retreat to the jungle. Many of the features that make Far Cry 4 fun
were already there.

Unfortunately somewhere around 50% completion it was revealed that a
walled-off part of the island was in fact inhabited by **mutants**!
The mutants were of course bigger, faster and more resilient than regular
soldiers. From there on the game deteriorated into some kind of poor man's
DOOM.

basement is nowhere near as fun as fighting soldiers in the jungle.</figcaption>

All this left a sour taste. A technically superb, fun first-person shooter was
ruined by introducing non-human opponents and changing the game to
hunting monsters in the dark.
