Walking. The answer's walking. For walking an hour in the woods you are  guaranteed at least one actionable idea.

This is just my personal experience though. I might have been able to lace this post with studies about exercise but, for your enjoyment, decided not to. That shit is quite dry. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurobiological_effects_of_physical_exercise">Neurobiological effects of physical exercise</a> is a good place to start if you want to read more. [Oh well, this one's pretty good too: <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/april/walking-vs-sitting-042414.html">Stanford study finds walking improves creativity</a>.]

##What kind of ideas are we talking about?

It's hard to say beforehand. Some examples of ideas I've had:

- A simple solution for that one programming problem at work
- How to improve our client's processes. (Really a small thing the computer could do when we push new versions live but it solves one really old problem.)
- What blog posts to write. Blog posts basically write themselves. The trouble is writing the ideas down.
- <a href="https://oivaeskola.fi/2015/02/23/moving-the-blog/">What to do with my website</a>
- Tons of new startup ideas :)

To generalize, it's usually stuff you've already thought about for a while, sometimes subconsciously. You might know the problem but not the answer. _Clarity_ is a good word for it. Things become clear.

##An hour though?

Yeah. One hour is a long time to take out of a day for doing "nothing". But it's a trade-off. You could also stay home and brute-force your way through your life's little problems. Walking is more fun.

Why walking works is this: after walking for half an hour in one direction your brain goes: *"Hmm, we are kinda far away from home. I guess there isn't much more to do than to just keep walking until we get back home."*

**This brief moment of your brain turning off is the valuable part.** It's a bit like how you often get the best ideas in the shower. Not having to do anything or think anything is rare these days.

Sure, you could maybe achieve the same in less time. But consider this old Zen proverb:

<blockquote cite="http://buddhism.stackexchange.com/questions/5632/who-said-if-you-are-too-busy-meditate-for-two-hours"><p>You should sit in meditation for 20 minutes a day. Unless you're too busy, then you should sit for an hour.</p></blockquote>

A busy brain needs more time to unwind. Short lunch walks might be OK too for increasing productivity and such, but personally I need longer pauses for completely resetting my brain. [Insert beer joke here]

##Just walking around?

Mostly. It helps to do it in nature. The quieter the better. Walking alongside a highway, or any way really, probably won't work as well.

Looking up a route of roughly 6 to 7 kilometers beforehand helps too. Not having to navigate or pick your phone leaves more time for thinking.

I'm a bit on the fence about listening to podcasts while walking. Some podcasts are inspiring and can help generate new ideas. Sometimes they are just filler for blocking the otherwise useful silence. I tend to sometimes listen to podcasts because everything I've said about walking in silence in nature is actually **hard to do**. It's pretty dull at first. But do realize that it's not a _guarantee_ anymore if you focus on someone else talking.

You might want to take notes on your walks. One option is to use Siri or Google Now to record reminders. On iOS you could also <a href="https://support.omnigroup.com/collecting-with-siri-in-omnifocus-2">sync your recorded reminders to OmniFocus</a>.

##Bonus: lose stress

Going for a walk is especially important if you are stressed out. It's hard to stay mad at trees. There's a bunch of research about this too and it often boils down to that even looking at pictures of trees relieves stress.

I'm very much aware that telling people how awesome exercise is usually does little to convince anyone to try it.
